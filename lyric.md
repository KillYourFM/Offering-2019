##OFFERING

Verse 1:

Bring all your blessings outside
biting lips, this auction
religion is this burden
you can feel it too

Sidewalk art, seen
sidewalk musician, scorned
and in the end
the ants regain control 

Chorus:

I can't explain this accident
I can't describe what's going on
if one day we all get blown away
only then could I tell the truth

Wash all your love from this body,
lipstick starting to burn
there's a crisis up in heaven
they know I'll never learn...

Outro Bridge

Bring all your gifts to this table
I'll supply the gasoline
burn away all these masks
burn away all these lies
